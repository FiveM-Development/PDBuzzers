# PDBuzzers
This is pretty self explanatory, There's a place at the counters at Mission Row PD, Sandy Shores SO, and Paleto Bay SO, Press L to buzz so cops or near players can hear and come to your assistance, there is also a cool down as well that can be adjusted.


Change Log:

    V1.1:
    - Make the wait times a local in the top so you dont have to change each one.
    - Make the radius where the buzz can be heard a local in the top
    - Make the audioName and audioRef a local in the top
    

ToDo:

    -Make it so you add coords to a spot to eliminate some code.
    -Make it so you can toggle the bell to prevent people from abusing it
